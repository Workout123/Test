NOTE: Please do run this on web server (apache) as the code uses ajax calls (CORS problems).

Assignments done:

1) Dropdown of cities. When clicked should show their description. (demonstrate using: closures, external js and json files, no global variables). 
2) Same functonality as #1 but using JQuery (this time reduce code lines as much as possible) ~ 20 for me.
3) Move an image using css properties and jquery. Create load by click event on button which creates load on main thread. And analyse the position of the animation before and after the load creation.
4) Repeat the same #3 one. This time the position of the image should start from the should-have-been position after the creation of load.
5) Styling the dropdown. One base script should implement calculating the price from the item count selected from dropdown. Create one more script which styles this dropdown. It should add - and + buttons by the sides of the dropdown. Implement respective functions. But the price calculation should continue as it is. 
6) Use jquery plugins to implement the #5. Spot the differences between #5 and #6.
7) Add on to #6. One more plugin when loaded, it should gray out + and - buttons on the out-of-range values. i.e. - button should gray out when item count is 1 and tooltip shouod display cannot be less than 1. + button on max-value and tooltip should display cannot go beyond <max-value>.
8) Simple ruby project "subtitle downloader" which downloads al available language subs of the videos in the specfied directory (current dir by default) - read more about this subtitle API on - http://thesubdb.com/
9) Small e-commerce like website (items and reviews) using rails 2.3.8 - basic
